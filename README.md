# SSIS deployment Checker
This is a python project that compares the local SSIS projects against the same ones found on the SSISDB of a particular server. A GUI is created that allows the user to pick the folder/server to compare and a easy to navigate view of the differences. It will also allow the user to deploy the project directly to the server using the Deploy Wizard.

## Prerequisites
To use this project, you will require the following Python modules.
* Pyperclip
* PyQT4
* lxml
* PyODBC
